==================================================
EASY MAINTENANCE FOR MULTIPLE CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS
==================================================

organize our several cloud environments for both purposes of
easy-maintenance and user-friendly, I think it is good that we provide
several simple commands to users like.


* fg-cloud-env list  --- showing the list of available cloud plat form.
* fg-cloud-env load eucalyptus --- loading eucalyptus
* fg-cloud-env load openstack --- loading openstack
* fg-cloud-env dumpzip eucalyptus...
* fg-cloud-env show... and etc...
